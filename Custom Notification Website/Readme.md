# Custom Notification Website

This website is a project I started in the beginning of summer 2023 and is being finished up. It is a a website to allow users to create their own custom notifications based on changes in other websites' contents. The front end is built using React js and the backend with Python Flask. The website also includes a login feature with JSON Web Token Authentication with Pyjwt. 

The final part to in progress is the webscraping program which utilizes Python Requests, multithreading, and rotated proxies to optimize web scraping techniques. It uses openAI API to generate notifications based on data collected from webpages' HTML properties.
