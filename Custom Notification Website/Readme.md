# Custom Notification Website

This website is a project I started in the beginning of summer 2023 and is being finished up. It is a a website to allow users to create their own custom notifications based on changes in other websites' contents. The front end is built using React js and the backend with Python Flask. The website also includes a login feature with JSON Web Token Authentication with Pyjwt. 

The final part in progress is the webscraping program which utilizes Python Requests, multithreading, and rotated proxies to optimize web scraping techniques. It uses openAI API to generate notifications based on data collected from webpages' HTML properties. 

# What I Learned
* Frontend development with React Js, HTML, and CSS and how to make a dynamic and user-friendly webpage
* Backend development and RESTful API implementation with Python Flask and SQL Alchemy
* User authentification with JWTs and CORS implementation for increased security
* Use of Python Requests for optimal web-scraping techniques
* Integration with OpenAI API to create custom notifications given changes in website contents

# Video Demo
Below is a demo I created showing the basic functionality of the website. The custom notifications are made in this demo using a text file made to represent the type of information that someone may want to receive updates about.
