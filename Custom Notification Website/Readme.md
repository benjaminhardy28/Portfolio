#Custom Notification Website

This website is a project I started in the beginning of summer 2023 and is almost finished. It is a a website to allow users to create their own custom notifications based on changes in other websites' contents. The front end was built using React js, CSS, and HTML. I built a Restful API using Python Flask. The website also includes a login feature with JSON Web Token Authentication with Pyjwt. 

The final part to complete is the webscraping program which utilizes Python Requests, multithreading, and rotated proxies to optimize web scraping techniques. It currently uses openAI API to generate notifications based on data collected from webpages' HTML properties.
