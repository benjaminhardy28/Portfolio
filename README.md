# Portfolio

My name is Ben Hardy and within this repository there are all of my projects, including demos and other relevant information. Here is a breif description of each project:

- Foot Controlled Computer Keyboard: This was a year long high school project where I built a foot controlled keyboard for individuals lacking upper body extremeties. This project make use of electronic circuitry and utlizies Python and C++.
- Platform Game: This was a group end of year project for my advanced Java class where we built a platform game from scratch using Java Swing. The game is connected to a REST API built with Java Spring Boot to save information about each user.
- Custom Notification Website: This was a project I worked on during the summer to develop a full stack website which allows users to customize notifications based on other websites contents. This project uses React Js, Python Flask, and Python Requests for webscraping.
- Language Translator: This was a device I built when I was 16 to allow for language translation from audio and image input. It is made up of a Raspberry PI Zero w, a USB microphone, an LCD screen, and a camera.
