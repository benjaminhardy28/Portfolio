This was a school project I completed in 11th grade when I was 16 years old. The device was created with a Raspberry PI Zero w, a USB microphone, an LCD screen, and a camera to allow for real-time language translation via audio input as well as image input of text. It is controlled by voice recognition commands to translate languages. It allows the user to translate any speech from another language into the user's language of choice by using Google Speech-To-Text API and Google Translate API. The device can also take pictures of text and translate it by using PyTesseract Optical Character Recognition API and Google Translate API. 

This device was a prototype to first develop before I started working on a pair of AR glasses to be implemented with the same functionalities. I developed and tested with a basic LCD screen and magnification although due to failue to get my hands on the needed technology, I was never able to fully pursue the glasses.

Here is a link to some videos showing how the device worked: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HCzMBTEKe2BwIPgyS7RjvYAbG4ltobmn?usp=drive_link
