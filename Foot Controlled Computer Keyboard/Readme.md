This is a group project that I led during my senior year of high school to develop a foot controlled computer keyboard. This project aims to provide greater accessibility to technology for people lacking upper body extremities. The controller itself has many unique and creative features to allow certain shortcuts for methods of typing in certain inputs. I was responsible for designing and building the electronic circuitry, as well as the software in C++ and Python. The keyboard is controlled with an Arduino DUE, and takes in inputs from several joysticks and mechanical keys, providing real-time USB input processing. I created a Python GUI enabling live visualizations of custom key properties and user-defined layouts which can be created and saved locally using Sqlite3. I made use of MVC principles, multithreading, and serial port communication for seamless functionality.
